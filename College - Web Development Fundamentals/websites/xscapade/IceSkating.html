    <p>Figure skating is dancing on ice and involves performing spins, jumps and spirals to music.</p>
    <p>The best thing about figure skating is that sometimes you get to pick your own music - Sugababes anyone? </p>
    <p>Make sure you know your 'death spiral' move from your 'camel spin', because judges award marks for style!</p>
    <p>As the name suggests, speed skating is basically zooming along as fast as you can on your ice skates. Races can be anything from 500 metres to 10,000 metres and can be done on your own or in a relay team.</p>
    <p>If you're fast you could reach speeds of 60km/h - try not to fall over though, as everyone will overtake you!</p>
    <p>In synchro skating eight or more skaters perform a routine to music - all in time with one another. The skaters form lines, circles and loads of other lovely shapes. Nifty footwork and graceful moves are essential.</p>
    <p>A panel of judges award marks for the routines, with the highest scoring team the winners.</p>
