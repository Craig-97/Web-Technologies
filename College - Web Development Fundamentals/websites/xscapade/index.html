   <h2>Welcome to Xscapade Sports</h2>
  <section>
    <article>
    <p>The definitive site to find out about some very exhilarating sports, namely Wind Surfing, Snow Boarding, Ice Skating and Skiing.</p>
    <p>In 1994 Snowboarding was declared as an Olympic Sport. Now it finally became accepted as a real competetive sport, not only a new trend which would disapear again. In the 1998 Olympics it was the first time ever that Snowboarding was accepted as an olympic sport. The new sport snowboarding was a huge success. </p>
    <p>If you've never been on skis before, forget about skiing for a few moments. Take some time to get used to your big slippers by walking on them. If you need to take exaggerated steps to move your feet forward, so be it. Choose a flat piece of land and go for a stroll, picking your skis right off the snow as you would your feet off the ground. Then begin leaning forward and tilting left and right and start bending your knees a bit as you take each step.
