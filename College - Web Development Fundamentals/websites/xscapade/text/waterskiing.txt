Waterskiing involves being towed along on the water by a speedboat while standing on two planks of wood! The trick is to see if you can stay on your feet without falling over. It takes a lot of skill, but looks awesome.

Waterskiing competitions include avoiding objects, pulling off some cool shapes and jumping really high!
