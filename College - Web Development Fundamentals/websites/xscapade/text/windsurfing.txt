Surfing

This sport involves catching waves on a board and then doing as many tricks and skills as you can before you fall in the sea! 
Though it may be slightly better in Hawaii or Australia, the beaches of the UK are still great places to surf.
Judges watch the surfers and then give them marks based on their skills and how difficult the wave was to ride.

Windsurfing involves riding on a board with a big sail attached to it to catch the wind. You do it in the sea or on a lake. If you're having trouble catching waves for surfing in the seas of the UK, then windsurfing might just be for you.

In competition you can do long distance, fast turning or simply pull off some cool freestyle tricks.
